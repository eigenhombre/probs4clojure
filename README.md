## 4clojure.com problems

These are my (and only my) solutions to problems on 4clojure.com. They
are still incomplete (2 remain to be solved).  See
`test/probs4clojure`; older solutions are in `solved_to_migrate.clj`;
**newer ones** are in `core_test.clj`; I use a macro in `test-util` to
present both the test cases and the solution in one expression.

Feel free to learn from these, but I solved the problems on my own
first in each case, and recommend you do the same -- the ones you find
the hardest, you may learn the most from doing.
